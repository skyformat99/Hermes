Hermes version 1.0

# Welcome to Hermes :)

## Hermes.

> _Hermes is an Olympian god in Greek religion and mythology, he is described
as quick and cunning._

> _Moving freely between the worlds of the mortal and the divine, he is portrayed as emissary and the messenger of the gods._

> _Hermes suffers from no limit. He loves to outwit other gods for his own satisfaction or for the sake of humankind._

Hermes is an attempt to define a new communication protocol based on [`Google protocol buffer`](https://github.com/google/protobuf) and [`Asio`](http://think-async.com/Asio).

In addition to being a new and easy way to see communication through sockets, Hermes, in his greatness, allows his users to be able to create `messengers`. Those entities could represent
any network software, and are pretty simple to use.

You will find all Hermes features in the documentation, as below.
